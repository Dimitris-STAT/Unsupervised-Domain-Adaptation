# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

This repository contains implementations of various unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, including CycleGAN, DeepCORAL with VGG16, and Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN). Additionally, it includes a manuscript/report in PDF format detailing the methodologies and results.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains all code implementations.
  - `cycleGAN.ipynb`: Implementation of CycleGAN for domain adaptation.
  - `deepcoral_vgg16.ipynb`: Implementation of DeepCORAL with VGG16.
  - `DANN.ipynb`: Implementation of Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN).

- `paper/`: Contains the manuscript/report.
  - `report.pdf`: Detailed report of the project, methodologies, and results.

## Installation
